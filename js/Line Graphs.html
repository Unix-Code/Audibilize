Graphs Bar Static

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1: The table below shows daily temperatures for New York City,
recorded for 6 days, in degrees Fahrenheit.

*Temperatures In NY City*
*Day* 	*Temperature*
1 	43° F
2 	53° F
3 	50° F
4 	57° F
5 	59° F
6 	67° F

The data from the table above has been summarized in the line graph below.

Temperatures in New York City

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2: Sarah bought a new car in 2001 for $24,000. The dollar value
of her car changed each year as shown in the table below.

*Value of Sarah's Car*
*Year* 	*Value*
2001 	$24,000
2002 	$22,500
2003 	$19,700
2004 	$17,500
2005 	$14,500
2006 	$10,000
2007 	$ 5,800

The data from the table above has been summarized in the line graph below.

Value of Sarah's car

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 3: The table below shows Sam's weight in kilograms for 5 months.

*Sam's Weight*
*Month* 	*Weight in kg*
January 	49
February 	54
March 	61
April 	69
May 	73

The data from the table above has been summarized in the line graph below.

Sam's weight

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Example1, the temperature changed from day to day. In Example 2, the
value of Sarah's car decreased from year to year. In Example 3, Sam's
weight increased each month. Each of these line graphs shows a change
in data <javascript:x2826022670('data')> over time.* *A *line graph* is
useful for displaying data or information that changes continuously over
time. Another name for a line graph is a line chart. The graph below
will be used to help us define the parts of a line graph.

Line graph

Let's define the various parts of a line graph.

*title* 	The title of the line graph tells us what the graph is about.
*labels* 	The horizontal label across the bottom and the vertical label
along the side tells us what kinds of facts are listed.
*scales* 	The horizontal scale across the bottom and the vertical scale
along the side tell us how much or how many.
*p**oints* 	The points or dots on the graph show us the facts.
*lines* 	The lines connecting the points give estimates of the values
between the points.

Now that we are familiar with the parts of a line graph, we can answer
some questions about each of the graphs from the examples above.

Temperatures in New York City

*_QUESTION_* 		*_ANSWER_*
1. 	What is the title of this line graph? *  * 	  	*Temperatures in New
York City*
2. 	What is the range of values on the horizontal scale? 		*1 to 6*
3. 	What is the range of values on the vertical scale? 		*0 to 80*
4. 	How many points are in the graph? *  * 		*6*
5. 	What was the lowest temperature recorded? 		*43° F*
6. 	What was the highest temperature recorded? 		*67° F*
7. 	At what point did the temperature dip? 		*Day 3: 50° F*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. 	What was the highest value recorded? 		*$24,000*
6. 	What was the lowest value recorded? 		*$5,800*
7. 	Did the value of the car increase or decrease over time? 		*decrease*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sam's weight

*_QUESTION_* 		*_ANSWER_*

5. 	What was the highest value recorded? 		*73 kg*
6. 	What was the lowest value recorded? 		*49 kg*
7. 	Did Sam's weight increase or decrease over time? 		*increase*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 4: The line graph below shows people in a store at various times
of the day.

People in a store

*_QUESTION_* 		*_ANSWER_*
1. 	What is the line graph about? 	  	*People in a Store*
2. 	What is the busiest time of day at the store? 		*1 pm*
3. 	At what time does business start to slow down? 		*3 pm*
4. 	How many people are in the store when it opens? *  * 		*2*
5. 	About how many people are in the store at 2:30 pm? 		*11*
6. 	What was the greatest number of people in the store? 		*22*
7. 	What was the least number of people in the store? 		*2*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 5: The line graph below shows the number of teens ages 13
through 19 in Smalltown that have cell phones.

Smalltown teens with cell phones

*_QUESTION_* 		*_ANSWER_*
1. 	What is the line graph about? 	  	*Smalltown Teens With Cell Phones*
2. 	At what age do teens have the greatest number cell phones? 		*19 years*
3. 	At what age do teens have the least number of cell phones? 		*13 years*
4. 	How many cell phones do 15 year-olds have? 		*341*
5. 	About how many cell phones do 16year-olds have? 		*500*
6. 	What was the greatest number of cell phones at any age? 		*642*
7. 	What was the least number of cell phones at any age? 		*229*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary: A line graph is useful in displaying data or information that
changes continuously over time. The points on a line graph are connected
by a line. Another name for a line graph is a line chart.
